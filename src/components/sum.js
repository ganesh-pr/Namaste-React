/**

- Install React Testing Library
- Install Jest
- Configure Jest (npx jest --init)
- Installed jest-environment-jsdom (Why? 29 version)
- Create my first test (JS, expect, test)
- Configure Babel (preset-env as import was failing)
- Wrote expect sum test
- gitignore coverage report
- React testing failed and we installed preset-react
- Provider
- Static Router from react-router-dom/server
- Our logo did not work. So, we created a mock image
- Fetch broke. We did a global fetch. We wrote our own fetch function where we resolved two promises
- Can you write the code for global fetch without seeing? Once you write, you will never forget
- Fetched data. How data will be loaded? What is data-testid
- HMR for testing (--watch)
- Error come warning that we ignored
- Shimmer testing
- toBeInTheDocument
- await waitFor and add async
- fireEvent
- fire a change event (understand why we wrote synthetic event)
